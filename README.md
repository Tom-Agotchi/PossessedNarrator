# PossessedNarrator
Hijack the windows narrator and have some fun. This is great to deploy on a friend's computer if they leave their computer unlocked. The narrator will read gibberish with a handful of real words and names tossed in every now and then. I tried to weight the vowels realistically and change the narrators pitch and speed frequently too. It also generates a MIDI file of random music notes and plays them in the background for an extra layer of creepiness. One version uses piano and the other uses many MIDI instruments at once.
